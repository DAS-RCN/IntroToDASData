    "### The FORGE Project\n",
    "The Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) project funded by the US Department of Energy and hosted by the University of Utah is creating an underground laboratory for developing and testing innovative tools and stimulation techniques for developing enhanced geothermal system (EGS) reservoirs. The R&D focus is on strengthening understanding of the key mechanisms controlling EGS success, specifically how to initiate and sustain fracture networks in basement rock formations through innovative drilling techniques, reservoir stimulation techniques, well connectivity and flow-testing efforts, and novel continuous geophysical monitoring methodologies.\n",

    "### Public Archive of FORGE (Phase-II) Data\n",
    "As of July 2020, the FORGE (Phase-II) data are publically available in the archive [here](https://constantine.seis.utah.edu/datasets.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This site provides access to the seismic data generated by the FORGE project. The data distribution is made possible by the University of Utah's Center for High Performance Computing (CHPC). Note: Near the FORGE project's completion, the waveform data collected here is planned to be transferred to the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology Data Management Center (IRIS DMC). When that time comes, we will announce that this service is deprecated\n",

    "### Setup environment\n",
    "Many of the Python packages we'll use are already available in Colab. We are going to use [Obspy](https://docs.obspy.org/) throughout, so we first need to install this package via pip. We also need to download a few auxiliary files from the web using wget commands. The FORGE DAS data are accessible through the Utah sites (links above). There is also a Python library with some modules available via Google Drive that we have made available for this workshop. To run a bash (command-line) command like wget in a Jupyter notebook on Colab, use an ! before the command. "

There is a scalar conversion from optical phase per timesample to nanostrain per second, and the report is effectively saying that this scalar multiplication has already been applied. The analogy here is how a seismometer records a voltage in V, but the instrument manufacturer may deliver data in m/s, having already applied the scalar V/m/s conversion factor.\n",

The first channel is probably located inside the IU, not at the IU/cable connection point. \"Tap testing\" is a good way to establish $\\textbf{\"Key Locations\"}$.

At FORGE, the key locations would be the wellhead and the channel that corresponds to the instrument/cable connection point. Additionally, it is possible to record DAS data beyond the physical cable's far end. Channels before and after the physical cable length should be masked in preprocessing. In Silixa's Survey Report (Figure 3, p.9), a tap test is described and the following fiber map is delivered:\n",
