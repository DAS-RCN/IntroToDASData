# IntroToDASData
A friendly introduction to reading and working with DAS data.

These are pulling data from a publicly read-able Google Drive directory called auxMaterialsFor2020DASWorkshop: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1faZs5psRbfH8RoBbjkgk1B1uKKkBrSP0?usp=sharing

Here's a short video on how to open up these notebooks in Google Colab and get started: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M0zMEaKgPEqW-Pt8XbB_S67iadKnWi-C/view?usp=sharing

Workshop/tutorial participants: note that after you make modifications to the notebooks on Colab, you'll Save or Save a copy in Drive to access later (you won't be saving a copy to the GitHub repo).
