# IntroToDASData
A friendly introduction to reading and working with DAS data.

These are pulling data from a publicly read-able Google Drive directory called auxMaterialsFor2020DASWorkshop: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1faZs5psRbfH8RoBbjkgk1B1uKKkBrSP0?usp=sharing

Here's a short video on how to open up these notebooks in Google Colab and get started: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M0zMEaKgPEqW-Pt8XbB_S67iadKnWi-C/view?usp=sharing

Workshop/tutorial participants: note that after you make modifications to the notebooks on Colab, you'll Save or Save a copy in Drive to access later (you won't be saving a copy to the GitHub repo).

Also, check out the new system for hosting Brady Hot Springs data on AWS! Start with this talk by Nicole Taverna and Michael Rossol (both at NREL):
